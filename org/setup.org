#+TITLE: How I set up my PC after a fresh Linux install

* Install vital programs
  1. Editors -- nano, vim, emacs
  2. WM -- Xorg and spectrwm (for now)
  3. Firefox
  4. git

** Vim configuration
   1. Make 

* Configuration
  1. Sound   -- install *alsa-utils* and enable system service if needed
  2. Network -- install *dhcpcd*

* Install fonts
  1. DejaVu, Liberation, Noto Sans (CJK and Emoji) -- system fonts
  2. Iosevka                                       -- Terminal and coding font
  3. Adobe Source Han Sans                         -- Japanese input

* Games
  1. DOOM -- install *Chocolate DOOM*, *Eternity*, and *GZDOOM*

** Chocolate/Crispy DOOM music
   1. Downloads eawpats.zip from Doomworld and extract
   2. Run *Chocolate DOOM Setup* and point to the location of the extracted timidity.cfg file
   3. If this doesn't work (like on Arch) and you get a message like "freepats.cfg doesn't exist", check the location of the SDL_mixer library and use the following command:

      strings /usr/lib/libSDL2_mixer-2.0.so.0 | grep timidity

      It'll output some valid locations for you to move the extracted timidity.cfg file to.

      (I created the /usr/local/lib/timidity directory and put the extracted timidity.cfg, with the *dir* directive to point to the extracted files, and voila!)
