[2021-10-22] This is, like, my fourth journal in a row. I love it. 'Kay, let me check. Today /arata/ reached basic dIsFuNcTiOnAlItY! It can fork and stuff. I have no idea if it destroys the user's PC in the processâ€”pun /intended/. Valgrind, oh Valgrind, where are thou? I found a nice meme today: *chaosposting*. Also, am still sick and it feels like dying. Very dramatic, I know. But I just want some peace, not people trying to push me down. I keep using *VIM* instead of *EMACS* for coding; it seems my brain has its preferences.
[2021-10-27] Wow, five days without posting? They go in the blink of an eye, I swear. I feel much better now, thanks God. I beat Metroid Fusion in *2:30* (or 2:40?) today. I may try to improve this time someday.
[2021-10-28] Today I slept very good around 3 o'clock. Called Cuqui and Raul, finally. Started playing *Chrono Trigger* and am speechless. It feels seamless, like no other JRPG has felt before. Dialog is not interrupted by moving, and everything feels so /alive/.
